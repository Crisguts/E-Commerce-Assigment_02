# MVC Web Application Assignment

## Overview
This repository is part of an assignment to demonstrate understanding of the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern and its implementation in a web application. The project involves extending the base MVC architecture with business logic and working as a team to integrate individual parts.

Each team member will work on a specific component, and all the components will be integrated into a common repository. The goal is to push the latest code to the repository, pull or clone the base code locally, make the necessary modifications, and push changes back to the repository.

## Group Work
- The project is a group assignment. All team members are expected to work together.
- **Repository Structure**: A common MVC repository will be used as the base, and each member will implement their specific section.
- **Commit History**: Itâ€™s important to preserve the commit history as part of the deliverable, which will be reviewed during the demo.
